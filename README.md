<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We will present the maintenance of personal medical information in the form of a separate software tool for filling in information about patients during their visit to the doctor. Thus, personal medical information will be an electronic medical record of the patient.

## The following functions are implemented in the program

- adding new users, editing their data, as well as the ability to block and delete them;
- adding new patients (creating new medical records), deleting them, restoring and editing their personal data;
- assigning administrator, registrar and employee (doctor) rights to the user;
- search for patients registered in the system by entering the patient's personal number (the number of his electronic medical card) or the patient's surname, first name, patronymic in the appropriate form;
- filling in the personal medical information of the selected patient when he goes to the doctor and passes examinations.

The software tool has the possibility of its further development and improvement.
